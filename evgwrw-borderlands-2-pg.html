I had a thought experiment after /u/LongenWhatNot‚Äòs post about a wizard city thinking not just about how a city would be run by mono-classes, but rather how a nation would form, be run by and change under those conditions. Fair warning not all of this has been game tested with this idea only really being tested on the town level so far in my game.

Appreciate any help or advice! Also I was recommended Powercolor.

I'm working on multiple large-scale series, and I was told by my friends that I have an obsession with making sprawling universes. That might not be wrong. But to go with that, I was told I should try my hand at something smaller, something that isn't full of scale with hundreds of different characters, plotlines, locations and the like. Something that's basic to get my foot in the door.
